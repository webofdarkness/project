# Web of Darkness

A d10-based system designed to manage character sheets for both Storytellers and Players, inspired by the tabletop RPG **World of Darkness** and its many dark reflections.

This project aims to provide a self-hosted environment where players can experience and track their chronicles in localhost servers, keeping the tone, mystery, and style true to the original spirit of the World of Darkness.

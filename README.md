## Description
A **d10-based system** designed to manage character sheets for both **Storytellers** and **Players**, inspired by the tabletop RPG *World of Darkness* and its many dark chronicles.

This project aims to provide a **self-hosted** environment where players and storytellers can experience and track their campaigns in local servers, preserving the tone, mystery, and atmosphere true to the original spirit of the *World of Darkness*.

### 🕸️ Features (planned and ongoing)

- **Local Installation:**  
  Installed directly on the Storyteller’s personal machine (localhost). The network connection is managed entirely by the host.

- **Access and Security:**  
  The Storyteller has a master account with password management and user administration features.  
  Each Player has their own login and can update their credentials safely.

- **Session Management:**  
  A single Storyteller can host multiple game tables.  
  Each session maintains its own set of characters, rules, and logs.

- **Character Sheet System:**  
  Storytellers can create and assign blank sheets to players.  
  Players can fill and update their sheets during gameplay — tracking evolution, damage, willpower, and more.  
  Storytellers have both summarized and detailed views of each sheet.

- **Chronicle Tracking:**  
  Sessions and characters are persisted locally, allowing long-term management of ongoing stories.

- **Patreon Integration:**  
  - A dynamic **Patrons List** available inside the system.  
  - Random background appearances for patrons.  
  - Exclusive showcase for **Antediluvian-tier** supporters.  
  - Monthly publication on YouTube every 13th night, featuring patron names.

- **Atmosphere Preservation:**  
  A design inspired by gothic themes — shadows, mystery, and elegance — keeping fidelity to the *World of Darkness* experience.
